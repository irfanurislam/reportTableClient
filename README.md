***Purchase Report Generator
**This project is a full-stack web application for generating and displaying purchase reports. It fetches data from an external API, stores it in a MySQL database, and generates reports that can be viewed on the client-side. Users can view a summary report on the home page and access a full, detailed report on a separate page. Additionally, the application calculates gross totals, such as the total price, total quantity, and overall product costs.
